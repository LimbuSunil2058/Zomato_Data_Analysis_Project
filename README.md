Zomato Data Analysis Project


Project Overview: 
 This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing information about restaurants listed 
 on Zomato. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about customer preferences, pricing 
 patterns, online ordering trends, and more. This analysis can be valuable for restaurant 
 owners, food delivery platforms, and data enthusiasts.

Dataset:
 The dataset contains several columns such as:
    * name: Name of the restaurant
    * online_order: Whether the restaurant offers online ordering
    * book_table: Whether the restaurant offers table booking
    * rate: Customer ratings
    * votes: Number of votes received
    * approx_cost(for two people): Approximate cost for two people
    * listed_in(type): Type/category of restaurant

Objective:
 The objective of this analysis is to:
  * Understand customer preferences.
  * Analyze pricing trends.
  * Identify factors that influence ratings and votes.
  * Study the popularity of online orders and table bookings.

Key Findings:
  1. Online Order Preference
    * A large number of restaurants offer online ordering.
    * Restaurants with online ordering options tend to attract more customers.
  2. Table Booking Trends
    * Not all restaurants offer table booking.
    * However, restaurants with table booking tend to receive more attention from customers, especially for dine-in.
  3. Rating Patterns
    * Restaurants with higher ratings generally receive more votes.
    * This indicates that good service and food quality directly influence customer engagement.
  4. Cost Analysis
    * Most restaurants fall within an affordable price range.
    * This suggests that the customer base is largely price-conscious.
  5. Popular Restaurant Types
    * Buffet-style restaurants appear popular in the dataset.
    * However, there is a diverse range of cuisines and types catering to different tastes.

Final Thought: 
  This analysis highlights that convenience, affordability, and reputation are the major 
  drivers for restaurant success on platforms like Zomato. Future strategies for restaurant 
  owners should focus on enhancing these areas while keeping an eye on changing customer 
  preferences.
